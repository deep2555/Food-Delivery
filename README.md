## üß† Challenges Faced

- **Frontend-Backend Sync**: Initially faced difficulties connecting the HTML forms with Spring Boot controllers, but overcame this by understanding Spring MVC form binding and request mapping.
- **Database Connection Errors**: Faced MySQL connection timeouts. Solved by checking firewall rules and JDBC URL formatting.
- **Session Management**: Implementing logout and user session handling was challenging, especially with Spring Security. Learned and applied `HttpSession` and CSRF handling for forms.

---

## üèÅ Results (So Far)

- Built a modular base for a food delivery system.
- Functional login, registration, and profile fetch features.
- Clean and responsive UI for basic user actions.
